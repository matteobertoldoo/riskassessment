# üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment Report

This project documents a comprehensive risk assessment conducted for an organization. The work involves mapping critical assets, identifying associated threats and vulnerabilities, and evaluating potential risks using a structured risk matrix.

The assessment begins with the identification and classification of key assets. Based on this, relevant threats and vulnerabilities are analyzed to understand how they could impact the organization. A risk matrix is then developed to prioritize risks based on their likelihood and potential impact.

To mitigate the most significant risks, a set of countermeasures is proposed. These are evaluated not only for their effectiveness but also for their feasibility and overall impact on risk reduction.

The goal of this assessment is to provide a clear, actionable overview of the organization‚Äôs risk landscape, supporting better decision-making in terms of security strategy and resource allocation.

All materials included in this repository represent different phases of the assessment process, from initial asset mapping to the final consolidated report.
